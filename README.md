# TerBot

TerBot is a simple terminal-based bot. It's just a playground for user to interact with the bots.
It is powered by [Api.ai](http://api.ai). It can be incorporated with Wit.ai also. It's written in angular.js .
There can be mistakes in the code or sometimes the bot might not understand as it is still in alpha stage and my bot needs a lot of training :)
